# Patterns

Patterns are reusable compositions of core components that solve common UI problems. Unlike built-in components, patterns are meant to be copied and customized for your specific needs.

## Why patterns?

Zen focuses on providing a minimal set of foundational components. Instead of shipping every possible UI pattern as a component, we provide examples showing how to compose our primitives to build common interfaces.

This approach gives you:

- **Full control** - Copy the code and modify it to fit your exact requirements
- **No bloat** - Your bundle only includes what you actually use
- **Learning** - Understand how components work together
- **Flexibility** - Adapt patterns to your design system

## How to use

Each pattern page includes:

1. A live preview of the pattern
2. Complete, copy-paste ready code with imports
3. Explanations of key concepts

Simply copy the code into your project and customize as needed.

## Available patterns

<Example>
  <DataTable
    data={[
      { name: 'Icon Label', description: 'Icon and text paired together' },
      { name: 'Nav Menu', description: 'Collapsible navigation menu with groups' },
      { name: 'Sidebar', description: 'Collapsible sidebar for application navigation' },
    ]}
  >
    <DataColumn id="name" label="Pattern" />
    <DataColumn id="description" label="Description" />
  </DataTable>
</Example>
