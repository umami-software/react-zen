# Introduction

**Zen** is a props-driven React component library built for speed. Created by the team at [Umami](https://umami.is),
it lets you build polished interfaces without writing HTML, CSS, or even thinking about Tailwind classes.

The components are built on [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) for accessibility and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, but you never have to touch either directly.
Just compose components and pass props.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/umami-software/react-zen).

## Why Zen?

Building UI is slow. You have to think about markup structure, CSS organization, responsive breakpoints,
accessibility, and design consistency, all before you can ship a feature.

Zen eliminates that friction. Instead of assembling Tailwind classes or writing custom CSS, you work with
**primitive components** that handle everything through props:

```jsx
<Box padding="12" border borderRadius="lg" shadow="lg">
  <Column alignItems="center" gap="6">
    <Heading size="3xl">Welcome</Heading>
    <Text color="muted" weight="medium">
      This is the zen way.
    </Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
  </Column>
</Box>
```

<Example>
  <Box padding="12" border borderRadius="lg" shadow="lg">
    <Column alignItems="center" gap="6">
      <Heading size="3xl">Welcome</Heading>
      <Text color="muted" weight="medium">{`This is the zen way.`}</Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
    </Column>
  </Box>
</Example>

No `className`. No CSS files. No memorizing utility classes. Just components and props.

## Design out of the box

Stop bikeshedding over colors, spacing, and shadows. Zen ships with a complete design system covering
[colors](/docs/design/colors),
[fonts](/docs/design/fonts),
[spacing](/docs/design/spacing),
[shadows](/docs/design/shadows),
and [borders](/docs/design/borders).

Everything works together. The spacing scale is consistent. The colors have proper contrast.
Dark mode just works. You get a professional-looking UI without making design decisions.

Need to customize? Override the CSS variables and the entire system adapts.

## Primitive components

Zen provides building blocks, not pre-built widgets. Components like [Box](/docs/layout/box),
[Row](/docs/layout/row), [Column](/docs/layout/column), and [Grid](/docs/layout/grid)
let you compose any layout through props:

- **Spacing**: `padding`, `margin`, `gap`
- **Layout**: `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, `direction`
- **Responsive**: `{{ '': 'column', md: 'row' }}`
- **Visual**: `border`, `borderRadius`, `shadow`

This is faster than writing Tailwind because you're working at a higher level of abstraction.
You don't assemble classes; you describe what you want.

## Accessibility included

Every interactive component is keyboard-navigable and screen reader-friendly, powered by
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/). Focus management, ARIA attributes,
and interaction patterns are handled automatically.

You don't configure accessibility. You just use the components.

## Props over classes

Zen inverts the typical workflow. Instead of starting with markup and adding styles,
you compose semantic components that already know how to render themselves:

| Traditional approach | Zen approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Write HTML structure | Compose components |
| Add Tailwind classes | Pass props |
| Handle responsive manually | Use responsive objects |
| Configure accessibility | Already done |

The result: less code, fewer decisions, faster shipping.
